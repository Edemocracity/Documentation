# Blind Croupier Bounty company!
Dear participants of bounty campaign! You can become a part of Bling Croupier project and we are happy to welcome you to our ranks. 
Total amount available for bounty 5,000,000WIN(1%).

# Bounty distribution order
The reward is accrued in proportion to the number of periods performed during each of 7 days. If you are not yet familiar with the distribution order of WIN tokens then please go to the token distribution page. The more periods that will be completed within these 7 days, the more tokens will be available for distribution. Distribution itself (sending tokens) occurs within the next week. Ammount of WIN tokens distributed for each completed period is listed in the table below:
> ATTENTION! Reward for Period 0 will be accrued  at the and of the period, without reference to the  7 day interval.

| Period  |  Ammount of tokens awailable for distribution for each completed period |
|---|---|
| Period 0  | 202,000WIN/Period |
| Period 1  | 278,000WIN/Period |
| Period 2 - 25  | 25,000WIN/Period  |  
| Period 26 - 125  |  15,0000WIN/Period |
| Period 126 - 367 |  10,000WIN/Period |

``If, in the aggregate, within a 7 days interwal worth of periods less then 60% of WIN is redeemed we reserve the right to put a hold for up to 40 days on tokens sent as a reward as a necessary measure to protect investors and stabilize the WIN exchange rate.``

> **Example 1:** You took a part in a bounty campaign for translators/community managers for wich you are entitled 1 share. Reward is accrued in proportion to the number of completed periods within 7 days. Lets assume that period 1-10 was completed in 7 days, so  503000 WIN is awailable for distribution, of wich 25% or 125750 WIN are for community managers. There were 10 participants or 10 shares, respectively you will recieve 10%, or 12575.

> **Example 2:** You took part in Twitter Bounty campaign, 2000 people are subscribed to your account and for each retweet you are entitled to 150 shares, the reward is accrued in proportion to the number of completed periods within 7 days.

You made 2 retweets in 5 days, for wich you get 300 shares out of 3000 shares (10%) or 7545 WIN.

# Reserve Bounty Fund 60% (3,000,000WIN)
For the proposed, gradual model for WIN token distribution, a flexible system is required for the rational distribution of the bounty. Since token distribution is broken down into many rounds its quite hard for us to predict which vacancy will be the most important for the project after some time.

Thats why we left a reserve that will be used to create new bounty campaigns (for example subscription campaign for Bitcointalk or campaign for PR management) and additional funding for existing ones. We will announce all new campaigns.

This reserve will be used to pay for individual project support, for example: PR managers, bloggers, youtube channel owners, news portals owners, Reddit subreddits, QQ and WECHAT channels, Telegram channels, even organizers, acquaintance with sponsors and advisors, product testers and many other necessary services. **Please write your suggestions, we are open to dialog and will consider every proposition, even if it is not on the list.**

Tokens for rewards are acrued on an individual basis and are not tied to the distribution order in periods, but at the same time we will not allow the situation when at any moment WIN token ammount distributed as a reward will be enough to destabilize token exchange rate. If in your opinion distributed rewards will be able to somehow destabilize exhange rate we will set a hold on the tokens of the person who privided this service for an agreed period of time.
