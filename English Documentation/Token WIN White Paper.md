# WIN Token Distribution

**WIN Token** - is Blind Croupier project's currency, used to measure other goods and services costs. All participants can use WIN to pay for goods and services of the Blind Croupier project. 

**Emission:** The total amount of WIN Tokens emitted is 500,000,000 WIN. There will be no further emission. A finite number of tokens will only decrease.

**All unsold tokens (if any) are destroyed at the end of every period.**

**5,000,000WIN:** Offered for Token Distribution Period 0. **Price for period:** 1000WIN = 0.35ETH. This is a small period for "early birds". The period finished when all the tokens available are distributed or when Period 1 starts .*All the unsold tokens are destroyed at the end of the period.*

**15,000,000WIN** Offered for Token Distribution Period 1. **Price for period:**  1000WIN=0.5ETH.  **The period begins 3.10.2017; 14:00UTC**  The period lasts 161 hours (or until all the tokens are sold), after that the next period begins instantly. *All the unsold tokens are destroyed at the end of the period.*

 **366,000,000WIN:**  Split for periods 2-367. For each period, 1,000,000 WIN is available for 23 hours. If the tokens are distributed ahead of time, the new period will begin without slowing down. In new period, the price is increased by 0.5% from the price in the previous period. **If** the previous period ended early, in the new period the price increases by 1%. **If** 20% or more of tokens were destroyed in the period, then the price would be maintained at the same level.
 
**100,000,000WIN:** Reserved by Blind Croupier to award project participants for their work and are considered a long-term investment. Also will be used for maintaining the marketmaker balance. The are put on hold and will be unlocked after 12 months.

**5,000,000WIN:** This tokens will be transferred to the market maker balance. A market maker is a dealer/bot/broker, storing WIN tokens and making transactions to maintain higher tokens liquidity on the market. 

**5,000,000WIN:** Reserved for the 'bounty' campaign. Tokens are distributed after each period and transferred to the participants' balances each 7 days.

**4,000,000WIN:** Reserved for the current and future Blind Croupier advisor. 

## About Token Distribution Model

The aforementioned Token Distribution model was developed to solve investors' problems which are, by our opinion and [blockchain community opinion](http://vitalik.ca/general/2017/06/09/sales.html), are most relevant.

1. Step-by-step investment - We look at this as at a great opportunity for an investor to look closer to the project, to assess how the given promises are fulfilled and divided the investment into stages. An investor, decided to take part in the Token Distribution will most probably be given a chance to do so. For us it is an opportunity to showcase our products during the Token Distribution and let the market vote for our project, final emission and the token price.

> It's worth mentioning, however, that if an extreme interest rises among the investors, new periods will finish and start without delays, which can, theoretically, lead to the fast end of period 367. But the price will also rise in this case, requiring further roadmap advancement and/or token destruction.

2. The low share boundary - An investor knows the total amount of tokens and their distribution. The only unknown figure is the amount of tokens issued to the marke (The maximum is known, but the minimum is unknownt). But in the case we decrease the emission after the investment, the investor's share will grow.

3. Limited emission - 500'000'000 WIN is a maximum emission limited by the smart contract. The total amount of tokens can only decrease.

4. No command center - the Blind Croupier team doesn't possess enough tokens to manipulate price. Even in the case of 50% of the tokens, which are offered to the Token Distribution, are destroyed, Blind Croupier team will own 32% of the total emission. 

5. Market efficiency - the offered model agility is based on the token price increase in new periods until the market are satisfied. If the demand decreases, the offer is decreased as well until the offer-demand balance is reached.

## Following Deflation Model Processes

Deflation is a contraction in the supply of circulated money within an economy in order to increase its buying power. Deflation processes is the basement of the Blind Croupier economic model during the initial token distribution stage as well as all the project lifetime.

We are tying the WIN token cost to the economical success of Blind Croupier. The main economic inidicator of the Blind Croupier efficiency is the royalty received from the casinos connected (13% of GGR, GGR = bets - wins).

At least 15% of the royalties will be used for **step-by-step** buying back WIN tokens and their withdrawal from circulation. The better project performs, the more funds will be used for token withdrawal. If WIN is definitely underestimated, more WIN will the withdrawn. If the market value is balanced - the lesser amount of WIN will be withdrawn (the higher the token price is, the less tokens we can buy back, using the funds designated).

>E.g. it is expected that online gambling market reached $52bln. in 2018. If all Blind Croupier connected casinos can take as little as 0.5% of the market, their yearly turnover will reach $260,000,000, GCR will be 5% or $13,000,000. 13% of which will be send to Blind Croupier as royalties ($1,690,000). From that amount Blind Croupier will use 15% ($253,500) for tokens buying back and destruction. Using the table below, let us compare amounts of tokens destroyed depending on their price:

| Tokens allocated / year | Average token market price  | Tokens destroyed / year |
|---|---|---|
| $253,500  | $1  |  253,500WIN  |
| $253,500  | $0.5  | 507,000WIN  |
| $253,500  | $0.25  | 1,014,000WIN |
| $253,500  | $0.1  | 2,535,000WIN  |

As you can see from the table, when the token price lowers, deflation speeds up and stabilizes the market. Accordingly, when the WIN token prices reaches the stable level (corresponding to the future Blind Croupier economics size) deflation will slow down. This model gradually increases the WIN token buying power, depending on the Blind Croupier effeciency, without using speculative methods.

## Liquidity

Limited emissions and constant tokens withdrawal during the project's lifetime makes it safe to store WIN tokens in a long-term perspective. It can, however, lead to inability to sell tokens by the market price or (in other words) low liquidity. To prevent this (as you may have already noticed from [distribution tokens](#win-token-distribution), there is a marketmaker. A marketmaker stores tokens and other currencies on its balance and actively buys and sells WIN tokens by market price, according to the algorithm programmmed. In other words, if you are going to buy WIN on the token exchange, you won't need to pay higher than market price to to this (as well as sell by the lower than market price). A marketmaker will buy or sell tokens by the market price.

## The Privilege Auction

Top 5 Investors (considering ETH spent by the end of Period 25) receive a free platform subscription for 12 months (as soon as platform is released) and a discounted royalty (7% instead of 13%) for 12 months. To participate, they need to invest from a single Ethereum wallet.
*We reserve the right of the winner to give/sell the privileges gained to the third parties.*

At the same time we will register a company and We will compile and submit the necessary documents for get a gambling license. We will expand our team to improve the product quality and development speeds. We will start developing the marketing campaign.

### Stage 3: Winter 2017-2018: Testing and Presentation

During Winter 2017, we will prepare the platform and the games for the open beta-testing. For the bugs and vulnerabilities found testers are going to get rewards. After that we will to present the platform and install it along with the games for the 5 winners of the privilege auction. This winter we are going to get a gambling license, after that BlindCroupier casinos will be able to use our merchant account to process Visa/MasterCard payments (and many other popular payment methods), without losing fairness and transparency of Ethereum block chain gambling.

### Stage 4: Spring-Summer 2018: Advanced Platform and Blind Jackpot Fund

Development and testing: The Blind Jackpot Fund, advanced platform, first video slots set, and optimization of all products for the mobile devices. After the testing is finished, we will present the ready product at all main online gambling events. The marketing campaign is to be started and the product launched to the main market.
